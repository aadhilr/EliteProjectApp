# EliteProjectApp
A standalone application that can create projects in basecamp.

When you've got files moving through your task list, it pays to have backups. With this Basecamp 2-Google 
Drive integration active on our dashboard, standalone app will automatically create a new file on Google Drive for 
every new attachment detected on Basecamp 2, copying all your material as it gets uploaded.

How It Works?
A new file is uploaded to Basecamp 2
App automation creates a new Google Drive file

2 - 
Your team can contribute to development from Basecamp just as easily as GitHub. 
Once you activate this functionality, any new todo added to a specific project list on Basecamp 2 will trigger the automation, 
passing the data to GitHub and creating a new issue with the details so you can track them all.

Still the project is not in  a position to publish
